Blockchain based Evault for legal records 
The eVault system, designed for secure legal records management, ensures robust user authentication and efficient document handling. Using Aadhaar or Pan card credentials with two-factor authentication, authorized users access the React-developed dashboard. This user-friendly interface enables comprehensive document overview, search, and filtering, allowing secure sharing and version tracking. MetaMask integration improves Ethereum-based decentralized application interaction, facilitating cryptocurrency transactions within the system. Blockchain ensures decentralized identity management, transparency in document verification, and secure encryption protocols. The system supports smart legal contracts, categorized by the Law Commission. This transformative approach addresses the shortcomings of traditional centralized systems, providing a secure, streamlined, and integrated solution for legal records in our digital society. 

Approach - 
MetaMask integration: MetaMask’s integration with blockchain-based vault systems, especially when combined with Ganache, provides a powerful and versatile solution for users working with decentralized applications (DApps) on the Ethereum blockchain. MetaMask and Ganache integration in the eVault legal declaration system  is to facilitate transactions with cryptocurrencies such as Ether.A user can seamlessly use his Ether tokens through the MetaMask wallet to pay for various legal services and transactions within the eVault system.
Dashboard :The platform offers intuitive web interfaces developed with React, suitable for different user roles, including lawyers, judges, and clients. The eVault system can have a user-friendly dashboard that allows authorized users to access their legal records with ease. This dashboard can provide a comprehensive overview of the user's stored legal records, including document types, dates, and any relevant metadata.
Access control and encryption: 
User Roles: Define various user roles within the E-Vault system. Administrators, lawyers, judges, and customers.
Role-based access control (RBAC): Implement the  RBAC mechanism to assign specific privileges and access levels to each user role.
End-to-end encryption: Implement end-to-end encryption to protect data in transit and ensure confidentiality of information in transit between users and the E-Vault system.
Document-Level Encryption: Encrypts individual legal documents stored in electronic vaults using strong cryptographic algorithms and key management techniques.
Download / Viewing of verified document: A crucial component of the e-vault system that ensures users of the legitimacy and integrity of stored legal records is the ability to view verified documents. At the point when a record goes through the check cycle, the framework outwardly implies its realness, imparting trust in clients.  The specific steps taken, the entities involved in the validation, and any relevant timestamps can all be viewed in detail by users regarding the verification process.

The downloaded documents are protected by encryption protocols in the e-vault system, ensuring that only authorized individuals can access the content. Each document also has a version history that the system stores, keeping track of changes and updates over time.
